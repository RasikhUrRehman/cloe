# Quick Start Guide: Job-Specific Sessions

## What Changed?

Your Cleo chatbot now supports **job-specific sessions**! When creating a session, you can pass a `job_id`, and the system will:

âœ… Fetch job details from Xano API  
âœ… Store job info in session state  
âœ… Give the agent full knowledge of the job  
âœ… Guide the agent to assess applicant fit  

## How to Use

### Step 1: Find a Job ID

Run this to see all available jobs:
```bash
python list_jobs.py
```

Copy a job ID from the output (looks like: `93626fb0-a859-4d0e-afa7-9f4854380e77`)

### Step 2: Start the API

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Or:
```bash
python run_api.py
```

### Step 3: Create a Session with a Job

**Option A - Interactive Demo:**
```bash
python api_client_example_with_job.py
```

**Option B - API Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_id": "YOUR-JOB-ID-HERE",
    "retrieval_method": "hybrid",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

**Option C - Python Code:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/create", json={
    "job_id": "93626fb0-a859-4d0e-afa7-9f4854380e77",  # Your job ID
    "retrieval_method": "hybrid",
    "language": "en"
})

session = response.json()
session_id = session['session_id']
```

### Step 4: Chat!

The agent now knows everything about the job and will:
- Ask relevant questions based on job requirements
- Assess your fit for the position
- Give honest feedback about your match

## Files Modified

1. **`chatbot/utils/job_fetcher.py`** (NEW) - Fetches jobs from Xano API
2. **`chatbot/state/states.py`** - Added `job_details` to EngagementState
3. **`chatbot/api/app.py`** - Added `job_id` parameter to session creation
4. **`chatbot/core/agent.py`** - Passes job context to prompts
5. **`chatbot/prompts/prompts.py`** - Updated prompts with job-aware instructions

## Helper Scripts

- **`list_jobs.py`** - See all available jobs and their IDs
- **`api_client_example_with_job.py`** - Interactive demo with job-specific session

## Key Features

### Agent Behavior:
- âœ… Knows full job details (title, requirements, responsibilities, etc.)
- âœ… Doesn't overwhelm applicant with all info upfront
- âœ… Asks targeted questions based on job requirements
- âœ… Collects applicant info through natural conversation
- âœ… Compares applicant to job requirements
- âœ… Calculates and communicates fit score

### Fit Score Assessment:
After collecting info, agent evaluates:
- Skills match (do they have required skills?)
- Experience match (right level of experience?)
- Availability match (can they work the schedule?)
- Location match (are they in the right place?)

## Example Conversation

```

## Testing

1. Start API: `docker-compose up --build -d`
